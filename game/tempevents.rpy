# okay so this is pretty much just a draft board
#
# uhhhh
#
# ok ok
#
# there's probably gonna be an introductory week where you're meeting everybody.
#
# After that, it's revealed that the courtyard/town/school/whatever is in a bad situation, depending on what you choose
#
# The 8 possible endings (ugh, this is gonna be a lot of writing) are with a combination of each of the people.
#
# Maybe i should write less endigns, depending on how I manage it.
#
# But there are certain things.
#
# For example, Charmed hates Hexed, because they're problematic, but Hexed calls them out on it,
#
# because hate is shit and it's not something you should have
#
# Hate requires ignorance. Hexed basically calls Charmed dumb.
#
# Also, Blessed is blind and so needs help from someone in order to survive.
#
# Hmm... maybe hexed could be on a wheelchair? this is gonna be interesting
#
# maybe if you and blessed are alone, you both die and you both die happy
#
# Maybe I could make just four endings - one with each character and one with all of them
#
# Or five, including one where you're all on your own.
#
# I'm excited about this project.

    h "You stop thinking. You stop, basically, existing."
    h "It's a leap of faith that your today self does towards your future self, without being completely sure what will happen."
    h "And during it, your mind is dead, for all practical means."
    h "It helps put life and death into perspective."
    h "Aren't they similar? The desire to stop existing, temporarily or permanently?"
    h "You might never understand why people want to die."
    h "But I hope sleep deprivation gets you close to that."
